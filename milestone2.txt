1.  Load Threshold value for all three sensors
2.  Polling till pushbutton being pressed
3.  Lego Car moves forward (make it slow using polling) and at the same time enable interrupts for sensors c
4.  Right Hand Rule:
    
    Not triggered (polling):
    a 1 b 1|0 c 1|0 : Move Forward
    a 0 b 1|0 c 1 : Turn Right
    a 0 b 0 c 0 : Move Back
    a 0 b 1 c 0 : Turn Left
    
    triggered:
    if it is moving back: turn right and move forward
    else    a 0 turn right
            a 1 turn right a little bit

    Notice: When making left or right turn, time should be accurate to finish the turning, and the interrupts should be turned off.
